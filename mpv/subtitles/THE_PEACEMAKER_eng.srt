00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:36,196
(Beeping)

00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:43,636
(Whispers)

5
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:02,357
(Serbian) Mr Minister.

6
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:06,438
Someone paged me, but no one's there.

7
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:09,555
(Serbian) l paged you.

8
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:13,109
Yes?

9
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,309
it couldn't wait
until tomorrow at Parliament?

10
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:24,755
No.

11
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:01,231
(Speaks Russian)

12
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:10,791
(Speaks Russian)

13
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:16,340
Have our START friends given us
permission to do our job yet?

14
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:18,670
Yes, sir.
And we didn't even have to ask.

15
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:21,272
Something wrong, Sergeant?

16
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:25,751
l didn't join the Russian Army to
dismantle it for the Americans, sir.

17
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:29,350
None of us did... The world changes.

18
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:31,992
We must change with it.

19
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:42,873
(Beeping)

20
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:59,358

(Speaks Russian)

22
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:32,755
Everything is ready?

23
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:34,709
Everything is ready, General.

24
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:38,555
Good luck.

25
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:40,758
Thank you, sir.

26
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:45,918
(Whistle blows)

27
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:09,730

(Beeping)

32
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:09,515
(Russian) What are they doing?

33
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:14,196
(Beeping)

(Brakes squeal)

35
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:24,754
(Russian) 8 minutes, 40 seconds.

36
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:27,308
No time to relax, boys.

37
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:30,478
0h, my God.

38
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:20,636
(Brakes squeal)

39
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:28,756

00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:35,712
(Speaks Russian)

41
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:37,279
0h, God. 0h, my God.

42
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:39,678
calm down.

43
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:40,954
We're going to die.

44
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:43,554
We're 15 km away. Under a mountain.

45
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:47,390
- l want my money.
- Be strong. You're an officer.

46
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:51,196
- I'm so afraid.
- No, no. it's time to be strong.

47
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:53,840
l don't think l am.

48
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:55,829
Pity.

49
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:57,797
(Gunshot)

50
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,956
Take him away.

51
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:32,999
(Beeping)

52
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:36,118
What happened?

53
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:39,954
l don't know, Dr kelly.
Please come with me, ma'am.

54
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:42,119
(chattering)

55
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:45,397
(Man) I've got estimates on
cloud size comin' through on six.

56
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:49,750
- What have we got?
- N0RAD's got R4 over sector 9877.

57
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:52,118
it's been localised.
60 degrees longitude, 50 lat.

58
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:55,351
- What about NPIC?
- Blast 40 minutes ago in the Urals.

59
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:58,591
Two trains collided. 0ne was
carrying warheads to cherbynsk.

60
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:00,636
Nice hair. Very au naturel.

61
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:02,915
Nuclear forces have gone to DEFc0N 3.

62
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:09,351
NMcc thinks Russia will use this to
veil troop movements into chechnya.

63
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:12,193
Not our problem.
Estimates from Livermore?

64
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:14,635
Five to seven hundred kilotons.

65
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:18,310
Mark Appleton's looking for you.
He's upstairs.

66
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:20,315
- All current data on my desk?
- Yes.

67
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:22,152
I'm gonna need a minute.

68
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:26,199
- Radiation pattern projections in?
- Yeah, but those aren't confirmed.

69
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:27,838
confirm them.

70
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:30,878
(Man) Russia, what a fucking mess.
l miss the cold War.

71
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:33,349
Get Essler down here now.
l need a translator.

72
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:35,795
Essler's gone. He quit to run JPL.

73
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:38,553
- Who did we appoint?
- My memo's on your desk.

74
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:41,752
- Who the hell's in charge there?
- Mark?

75
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:43,836
Mark? Excuse me.

76
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:48,518
Sorry. Forget chernobyl.
This is... This is huge.

77
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:51,672
Dr Julia kelly, Acting chair,
Nuclear Smuggling Group.

78
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:55,275
- Terry Hamilton, Security Advisor.
- We met last year.

79
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:59,512
I'm briefing the President to explain
how, with our START team there,

80
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:01,670
an accident like this could happen.

81
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:03,716
it wasn't an accident, sir.

82
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:06,360
I'm sorry?

83
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:10,557
We believe that train was carrying
SS18s, which are 0ne Point Safe.

84
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:13,677
- What's she saying?
- lf you fire a bullet at the warhead

85
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:16,558
there's a million-to-one
chance of it going off.

86
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:18,710
it must be ignited
by its own trigger.

87
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:22,110
Would you hold this, please?
Here we have the satellite imagery.

88
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:25,351
This is the two trains approaching,
and here's the collision.

89
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:27,829
Now check out the field of regard.

90
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:31,754
These shots are at the same height
cos they occurred at the same time.

91
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:36,391
Look. The blast is two degrees higher
after the satellites passed over.

92
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:37,993
Time between shots?

93
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:41,311
Between the train wreck
and the detonation, 4 minutes.

94
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:45,712
Somebody set that nuclear weapon off.
This was a terrorist act.

95
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:48,109
Full NSC briefing at 9:00am.

96
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:51,875
The Russians' accident story
will stand for now. No press leaks.

97
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:54,349
Nobody shows up on Nightline.
Doctor...?

98
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:55,953
kelly.

99
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:59,271
I'm putting your group on point
until l find a replacement.

100
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:01,197
Yes, sir.

101
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:05,710
Get me satellite overviews
and keep the updates coming.

102
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:14,113
0k, State, we're gonna need
talking points for the President.

103
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:17,875
We need to know who might want
to detonate a nuke on Russian soil.

104
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:21,873
General, I'll need a military liaison
with Russian contacts.

105
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:24,110
- You got it.
- 0h, and General,

106
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:27,158
make sure he's willing
to take orders from a woman.

107
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:30,730
'(Woman) colonel Devoe,
looking at events of May 18.'

108
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:33,277
You were arrested in a bar brawl

109
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:36,312
in a Moscow disco
called...Night crawler?

110
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:39,278
Yes, ma'am, that's correct.

111
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:41,749
You were in the company
of a prostitute

112
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:44,593
and a Russian army colonel named

113
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:46,750
Dimitri Vertikoff?

114
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:51,436
Yes, ma'am. Dimitri and l went into
the bar to try and buy some nerve gas

115
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:54,800
off this ex-KGB guy that we had heard

116
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:58,711
was selling black market
surplus munitions to Iraq.

117
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:01,712
The fight started because
we'd run up a bit of a bar tab...

118
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:04,997
l believe the exact
amount was $5,200?

119
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:08,197
Well, we had dinner,
and l bought a couple of rounds.

120
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:10,999
colonel Vertikoff
identified the KGB guy,

121
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:14,709
and we were able to stop
the nerve gas from getting to Iraq.

122
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:16,916
So how do you repay a man like that?

123
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:20,310
- Sports utility vehicle?
- That's exactly right.

124
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:22,914
Dimitri has a daughter
who likes four-wheeling.

125
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:26,675
l know this Ford guy who cut me
a great deal on these Explorers.

126
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:30,700
- l like the Bronco better...
- colonel, let's get this straight.

127
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:34,199
You spent taxpayers' money
to buy and ship

128
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:36,714
a Ford Explorer 8,000 miles

129
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:40,315
to the teenage daughter
of a Russian colonel?

130
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:42,356
Yes, ma'am.

131
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:46,797
Think of it as exporting goodwill.

132
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:30,439
(Russian) We never discussed
detonating a bomb.

133
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:35,470
lf they discovered missing warheads
they would have found us in hours.

134
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:39,189
Now it will be days before they even
reach the crash site.

135
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:44,720
l hate these new ones.
They don't seem real.

136
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:46,749
He looks bug-eyed, deformed.

137
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:48,831
They'll have the roads blocked.

138
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:51,480
Your Russian is awful. Speak English.

139
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:53,516
It was stupid, understand?

140
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:56,558
Your friends made this deal,
but this is my operation.

141
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:59,393
Don't make me start thinking
l don't need you.

142
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:02,597
- They will never let us through.
- 0f course they will.

143
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:05,717
Section 21-A,
Nuclear Disaster Protocol.

144
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:08,473
One, secure area.
Two, control debris.

145
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:10,915
Three, evacuate casualties.

146
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:13,356
(Speaks Russian)

147
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:18,320
Huh?

148
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:20,636
it was stupid.

149
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:25,355
(kelly) ..but they have the know-how
and should not be ruled out.

150
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:29,194
And moving on, we come to
Shamil Basayev, a scientist.

151
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:31,396
He claims responsibility for placing

152
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:35,553
a canister of radioactive caesium
in a park in Moscow last June.

153
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:39,918
But his underworld ties suggest he
could be part of a bigger operation.

154
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:47,515
Zelimkhan Yandarbiyev. chechen leader
since the Russians murdered Dudayev.

155
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:51,195
He has threatened to attack
Federation nuclear power plants.

156
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:55,717
There are others on our terrorist
list, as outlined in your packet.

157
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:59,310
0ur reaction to the crisis
is as follows.

158
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:02,908
We have initiated a directive with
the Nuclear Smuggling Group as hub.

159
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:06,959
DIA and NR0. You have responsibility
for primary SAT imagery...

160
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:09,793
Excuse me, ma'am.
l don't mean to interrupt.

161
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:12,553
- Yes?
- Um, these terrorists...

162
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:15,740
Have they asked for anything,
a list of demands?

163
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:17,116
Russians out of chechnya...?

164
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:20,272
No, but it's not unusual for days,
even weeks to go by

165
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:22,794
before a claim of responsibility
is made.

166
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:24,836
- Yeah.
- Air mob command is...

167
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:27,480
Excuse me again. Ma'am. I'm sorry.

168
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:32,760
That's a satellite shot of the
trains just before they collided.

169
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:35,277
Perhaps you should discuss
Special 0p possibilities?

170
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:39,558
Right. General Garnett has Special
0perations command at full alert.

171
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:42,757
- Excuse me.
- I'm sorry to keep interrupting.

172
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:45,400
You see these blobs right here?

173
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:49,996
Those are people jumping off
the train before it crashes.

174
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:53,380
Now look at that train.
That's the one with the nuke.

175
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:57,838
Nobody's jumpin' off that. Why not?

176
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:02,551
They were already dead.

177
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:06,234
(Man) How many warheads
were on the train?

178
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:09,232
The Russians haven't confirmed yet.

179
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:12,471
So we have no idea
of potential yield?

180
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:18,115
Are you suggesting
this was a robbery?

181
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:22,193
Whoever did this had access to
Russian satellite positioning intel.

182
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:24,635
That leaves out your chechen rebels.

183
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:26,278
(Murmuring)

184
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:28,396
l would like to point out

185
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:31,916
that 1,500 people
were killed last night.

186
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,276
You don't do that unless you want
to make a profound statement.

187
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:38,238
Do you know how much a nuke
is worth on the market?

188
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:40,356
Minimum $200 million, cash.

189
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:43,000
$200 million
is a very profound statement.

190
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:46,152
I'm sorry, ma'am.
The detonation was a smoke screen.

191
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:49,471
This was a hijacking,
and whoever stole these things

192
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:51,710
got off the bus a long way back.

193
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:53,791
(Murmuring)

194
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:58,430
Well, we will certainly be
considering your theory.

195
00:24:58,520 --> 00:25:00,476
Thank you very much.

196
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:02,949
Well, it's just an opinion.

197
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:08,189
Whoever has current data on the
blast, l need it on my desk ASAP.

198
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:10,236
(Woman) You got it!

199
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:14,639
ken, try to get Russian Missile
command on the phone, please.

200
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:36,760
(Speaking Russian)

201
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:54,875
(TV) 'Reports say...'

202
00:25:56,920 --> 00:26:00,913
- Anything on DIA?
- We should have Russian intel soon.

203
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,992
l need the START report.
Not just the summaries.

204
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:07,380
- Not just the abstracts, all of it.
- I'm all over it.

205
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:10,874
- And where is my military liaison?
- Right here.

206
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:13,476
Lieutenant colonel Tom Devoe,

207
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:15,835
reporting as ordered, ma'am.

208
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:19,879
My enthusiasm sometimes
gets the best of me.

209
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:23,270
l hope that l didn't
offend you in there.

210
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:25,237
No, of course not.

211
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:27,880
- coffee?
- I'd love some.

212
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:29,552
0ver there.

213
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:32,313
(ken) Russian Missile command's
on line six.

214
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:36,750
I'd like to reiterate our commitment
to helping you find some answers.

215
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:38,151
Yes.

216
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:42,279
- No, l understand, General.
- l brought you some coffee.

217
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:46,879
Uh, that's right.

218
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:50,509
We need to know
exactly who was on that train.

219
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:55,355
Uh, no, l am the man in charge.
l report directly to the President.

220
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:58,512
What do you want me to say?

221
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:04,593
l don't see what has to do
with anything.

222
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:08,593
Yes, well... l see.

223
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:10,432
No, l understand.

224
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:12,795
l think... l mean
l know l have a couple.

225
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:18,596
All right. lf you would
be able to get back to me

226
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:23,390
with the names of the men who were on
the train and the number of warheads,

227
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:26,740
- that would be wonderful.
- In my office.

228
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:28,674
And how long
do you think that will take?

229
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:30,796
Well, uh...

230
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:34,994
I'll be expecting your call.

231
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:37,360
Thank you.

232
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:56,310
(All talk at once)

233
00:27:57,040 --> 00:27:58,871
(kelly) We got the confirmation.

234
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:02,635
-There were 10 warheads on the train.
-Forty men on board.

235
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:05,871
- This is meaningless.
- it's in Russian.

236
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:09,714
(Russian) it's meaningless because
they haven't listed anybody's rank.

237
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:11,836
Where did you learn to speak Russian?

238
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:13,558
Princeton.

239
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:16,108
The blue-blooded backbone
of our country.

240
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:19,636
- My father's a mailman.
- Well, you'd never know.

241
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:22,558
"Ilin, kodoroff, kulik,
Levindovsky..."

242
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:26,872
- kodoroff? Aleksander kodoroff?
- Yeah. You know him?

243
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:29,235
Yeah, l know him. God damn it!

244
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:31,276
l don't know about these other guys,

245
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:35,353
but General kodoroff doesn't ride
around on a nuclear transport train.

246
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:37,237
Get me NMCC lntel, please.

247
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:41,740
- it's like Ivana Trump on a subway.
- can you get my files?

248
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:44,511
- Have that enhanced off the Urals.
- Yes, sir.

249
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:45,953
Sergeant.

250
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:48,600
kodoroff's under investigation
for corruption,

251
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:50,511
probably gonna be indicted.

252
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:53,340
Gave a speech nine days ago
in St Petersburg.

253
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:56,590
Mostly nationalistic bluster,
bemoaning the loss of empire

254
00:28:56,680 --> 00:28:58,875
and unity of the Slavic peoples.

255
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:03,112
Family history, phone records,
bank statements.

256
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:07,876
Urinalysis from a Moscow
traffic stop last month - .367.

257
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:11,430
- I'm amazed he could turn the key.
- That's a few cocktails.

258
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:15,877
Saw his dentist Tuesday, dined with
some attractive people on Friday.

259
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:20,780
- Haven't been able to ID them yet.
- costello, you're slipping(!)

260
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:23,357
- 0h, I'm gettin' old, sir.
- You're not old.

261
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:25,556
General Garnett's old.

262
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:28,438
If you don't mind me askin',
is kodoroff involved?

263
00:29:28,520 --> 00:29:31,990
- We don't know. He was on the train.
- You see, that's funny.

264
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:33,433
Why?

265
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:35,511
The General's got a Finnish mistress.

266
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:37,716
- Lives in Helsinki.
- Laina.

267
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:40,951
The guy calls her every day
like clockwork.

268
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:43,110
- So?
- Well, the thing is,

269
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:46,317
if kodoroff was on
that train and he's so dead,

270
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:51,554
who's calling Laina in Helsinki off
some satellite over southern Russia?

271
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:56,548
lf that's a secure phone, l need it.
Excuse me, General.

272
00:29:58,360 --> 00:30:01,158
lf a top-ranking
Russian general is involved,

273
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:05,280
any intel we get from Moscow
is either compromised...

274
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:07,236
Palkawunic Vertikoff.

275
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:09,754
- ..or a flat-out lie.
- You're right.

276
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:11,717
Dimitri, Tom Devoe.

277
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:14,394
- 'What do you want?'
- Are you busy?

278
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:17,517
I'm with two women.
call me back some other time.

279
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:20,512
- 'How are you guys holdin' up?'
- The only virtue is,

280
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:22,591
people are forgetting chechnya.

281
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:26,195
Yeah. Listen, I've got the
troop manifest from that train.

282
00:30:26,280 --> 00:30:29,670
Alek kodoroff got vaporised
out there, did he?

283
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:33,509
- 'Yeah. What a shame.'
- Yeah.

284
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:37,912
So how is it he's calling Laina
from a bird over southern Russian?

285
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,360
How's he doin' that?

286
00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:47,780
'Are you still there?'

287
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:48,991
'You must be wrong
about that, Tom.

288
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:53,358
'0ur figures indicate the fallout
should have dissipated by then.

289
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:56,671
'Let me fax you what we've got.
Your number?'

290
00:30:56,760 --> 00:30:59,513
Hold on. Fax number, please. Hang on.

291
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:02,353
All right, 0-0-1-7-0-3...

292
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:05,512

- Six-eight.

293
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:08,672
I'm going to hang up now. Bye.

294
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:10,876
Listen...

295
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:16,716
That scared him.

296
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:22,635
- Is this the fax?
- Yes, sir.

297
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:31,798

nuclear weapon incident in Russia

Why Vienna?

- kordech.
- Maybe.

310
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:08,797
kordech is a front for
the Russian Mafia in Vienna.

311
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:10,791
And it's a trucking company.

'Whether it was an accident or an
act of terrorism remains a question.'

intel from the Urals,

updated fallout patterns
and troop movements from NAT0 humint.

Honey-roasted. Think anybody'll
mind if l stole a couple of bags?

My old man will love
the Executive Seal.

317
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:39,157
Go ahead. knock yourself out.

318
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:42,710
Would you call Langley? We're waiting
for kodoroff's psych profile.

319
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:44,995
He's an asshole.
I'll save you a trip.

320
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:47,548
Thanks. I'll go with
the official version.

321
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:49,949
0k. 0fficially, he's an asshole.

322
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:52,713
He'll do anything for money,
which is good,

323
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:54,756
cos it makes him predictable.

324
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:57,308
I'd say he's been
anything but predictable.

325
00:32:57,400 --> 00:33:01,154
He took an order for
an expensive, hard-to-find product,

326
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:05,677
and he intends to make good
on delivery - supply and demand.

327
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:09,833
Your area of expertise, colonel?
That's the word on the Hill.

328
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:15,150
You've been checkin' up on me.

329
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:18,312
l like to know who I'm working with.

330
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:24,830
I'd like to know something.

331
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:29,755
You moved from Lawrence Livermore
to the White House.

332
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:33,992
So, first you build the bombs
to blow up the entire world

333
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:36,640
and now you wanna save it.

334
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:38,711
Make up your mind, which is it?

335
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:42,793
Well, l believe this week
we're saving it.

336
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:49,159
- So, it's really that simple?
- it is to me, that simple.

337
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:52,710
When you've been the boss for more
than two weeks, you'll know that.

338
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:56,588
Three weeks.
You've done some checkin' yourself.

339
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,753
l like to know who I'm workin' with.

340
00:34:02,360 --> 00:34:05,830
You can run your charts
and your theories all you want.

341
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:08,354
In the field, this is how it works.

342
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:10,192
The good guys, that's us,

343
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:12,953
chase the bad guys,
and they don't wear black hats.

344
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:14,871
They are, however, all alike.

345
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:19,112
They demand power and respect,
and they'll pay top dollar to get it.

346
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:21,839
And that is our
highly motivated buyer.

347
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:25,117
- What about other motivations?
- Not important to me.

348
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:29,751
Either way, there are people who
don't care about money or respect,

349
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:32,832
who believe killing
innocent people is justified.

350
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:37,720
For them it is about rage,
frustration, hatred.

351
00:34:37,160 --> 00:34:39,355
They feel pain and want to share it.

352
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:42,557
That does me no good.
Let's deal with the facts at hand.

353
00:34:42,640 --> 00:34:47,395
23 hours ago, General Aleksander
kodoroff stole ten nuclear warheads.

354
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:49,835
He's just a delivery boy.

355
00:34:50,640 --> 00:34:55,111
I'm not afraid of the man who
wants ten nuclear weapons, colonel.

356
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:57,794
I'm terrified of the man
who only wants one.

357
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:02,397
(children chattering in Serbian)

358
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,753
(chattering in Serbian)

359
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:55,793
(Serbian) No, no, no. Listen, listen.

360
00:35:56,920 --> 00:36:00,370
Music should be
like a language, child.

361
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:03,196
Listen.

362
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:11,432
Joy.

363
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:19,750
Sadness, you understand?

364
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:39,720
changing a single note can turn joy
to sorrow. Your turn.

365
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:57,556
(Phone rings)

366
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,399
Professor?

367
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:08,309
(Ringing continues)

368
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:13,518
- 'Hello?'
- Dusan? it's me, Vlado.

369
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:16,990
- 'Is everything 0k?'
- Yes, we're on schedule.

370
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:19,710
Brother, listen to me.

371
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:24,311
I'm scared.

372
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:33,953
(Devoe) Hey, look who's
the secret agent!

373
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:36,349
Nice hat. You don't stand out at all!

374
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:38,635
Dress shoes with khakis?

375
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:42,715
- Look at you.
- Leave me alone.

376
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:45,360
Listen, whatever happens, deny it.

377
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:48,591
0k. These are CDs for Tasha.
You will not like them.

378
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:50,477
How is she?

379
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:54,712
16, and in love with
a 20-year-old motorcross racer.

380
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:57,439
- She said to say hello.
- Send her my love.

381
00:37:57,520 --> 00:37:59,909
Is kodoroff involved with kordech?

382
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,355
Dr Julia kelly,
colonel Dimitri Vertikoff.

383
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:04,795
Dr kelly heads
the Nuclear Smuggling Group.

384
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:07,750
- With the White House.
- With the White House.

385
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:10,550
(Russian) A beautiful woman with
a PhD. You're out of your league.

386
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:12,710
(Russian) You have no idea, colonel.

387
00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:15,312
That's good.

388
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:17,834
l think we can do business, Dr kelly.

389
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:21,117
- Let's take a walk.
- 0k, let's take a walk.

390
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:26,149
(Woman singing in German)

391
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:33,519
(Dimitri) They sit here and drink.
We might as well join them.

392
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:36,680
(kelly) We've monitored
kordech for years,

393
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:39,630
but it's always been
a Mafia/ex-kGB operation.

394
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:42,837
Till recently. You must see
it in the context of my country.

395
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:46,799
kodoroff's generation of officers
grew up in a crumbling system.

396
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:49,750
Those pictures
in your head of Russia,

397
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:52,357
bread lines, shitty little
apartments, ancient cars.

398
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:56,638
kodoroff and his friends made sure
that it never applied to them.

399
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:59,951
But now, even that system
is crumbling.

400
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:03,191
This was kodoroff's way out,
his big score.

401
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:06,113
So we're here because Y0U
can't investigate kordech?

402
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:09,590
No, l can't investigate
without alerting kodoroff.

403
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:12,433
Half the men used to be in my unit.

404
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:17,639
Mr Dietrich Shummaker schedules
all Russian shipping for kordech.

405
00:39:17,720 --> 00:39:19,676
You have an appointment at 4:00.

406
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:23,673
(Devoe) Good, let's go
see a man about a truck.

407
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:25,716
That's gasoline!

408
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:47,268
- Do you have them?
- Yes. We have to begin immediately.

409
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:16,436
Just remember the plan.

410
00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:18,670
- I'm Anthony Haden...
- I'm Patty carson.

411
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:21,558
We go in, we get the information.
then we get out.

412
00:40:21,640 --> 00:40:23,915
You call me Tony. Here we go.

413
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:27,675
Hi, I'm Anthony Haden.
This is my associate, Patty carson.

414
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:30,877
- Herr Shummaker's expecting us.
- Please follow me.

415
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:41,393
(Receptionist)
'Make yourselves comfortable.'

416
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:43,198
Thank you.

417
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:48,113
Trucking business
must be pretty good.

418
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:51,272
l wonder what chateau in
the Loire Valley these came from.

419
00:40:51,360 --> 00:40:53,794
Mr Haden? Welcome.

420
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:55,757
Thank you very much for seeing us.

421
00:40:55,840 --> 00:40:58,434
This is my associate, Ms carson.

422
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:01,192
Nice place you have here.

423
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:03,236
My taste is for the Italians

424
00:41:03,320 --> 00:41:07,740
but the German late Baroque
was influenced by the Italians.

425
00:41:07,160 --> 00:41:10,118
Several of our paintings are Italian.

426
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:13,237
- That's a Tiepolo.
- 0h, yeah.

427
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:18,314
I'm a big Leroy Neiman fan.
Are you familiar with his work?

428
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:20,709
- No, I'm afraid not.
- No? 0h.

429
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:22,950
- Please, come in.
- Sure.

430
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:24,917
To my office.

431
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:28,356
- 0h, now, this is nice.
- Thank you.

432
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:30,396
Have a seat.

433
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:34,356
How can we help you?

434
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:38,115
l just wanted some information
about trucking in Russia.

435
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:41,749
l might not be the right man
if you need to rent equipment.

436
00:41:41,840 --> 00:41:44,700
You're the head
of transportation, right?

437
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:46,116
The head?

438
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:48,634
- No, l just do the scheduling.
- Right.

439
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:51,951
You're the guy who gets things done.
Smart, put a German on it.

440
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:57,750
Yes, well.

441
00:41:57,160 --> 00:41:59,469
As l said, how can l help you?

442
00:41:59,560 --> 00:42:01,551
Well, what we wanna know is,

443
00:42:01,640 --> 00:42:05,349
if l wanted to rent a vehicle to
steal and transport nuclear weapons

444
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:08,790
from somewhere, let's say,
inside the Urals,

445
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:11,152
would you be the guy to talk to?

446
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:18,871
Would you be that guy?

447
00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:36,556
No, I'm afraid not.

448
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:38,949
l believe our meeting is over.

449
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:41,876
All right, thank you for...

450
00:42:41,960 --> 00:42:44,349
- Do you like Ford Explorers?
- We have to go.

451
00:42:44,440 --> 00:42:46,954
Range Rovers, Land cruisers?

452
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:49,793
Mr Haden, will you leave the room?

453
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:51,309
No!

454
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:53,516
Should've taken the money, Hans!

455
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:58,157
- Get up and get behind that desk.
- You broke my nose!

456
00:42:58,240 --> 00:43:00,708
Not a word.
Get the tape out of my briefcase.

457
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:04,873
l won't shoot you unless l have to,
and I'll feel bad about it. Sit down!

458
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:06,951
Give me the tape.

459
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:21,518
- l need the password. What is it?
- Hang on.

460
00:43:21,600 --> 00:43:24,114
- The password.
- No.

461
00:43:24,200 --> 00:43:25,599
All right, hang on.

462
00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:28,240
All right, Hans,
we'll do it your way.

463
00:43:28,680 --> 00:43:31,433
How's the backhand? Password?

464
00:43:33,120 --> 00:43:35,760
- Hasselhoff.
- Hasselhoff.

465
00:43:35,160 --> 00:43:38,197
Hasselhoff...
How do you spell "Hasselhoff"?

466
00:43:39,840 --> 00:43:42,877
Way to go, Hans. Very brave.

467
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:49,912
I'm in.

468
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:54,391
l need the trucking invoices
for the last seven days.

469
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:56,436
All right.

470
00:44:08,320 --> 00:44:10,788
- This is your plan?
- Yep.

471
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:14,555
- This is your big plan?
- This is...my plan!

472
00:44:23,640 --> 00:44:25,153
(Devoe) Hurry up.

473
00:44:28,280 --> 00:44:31,397
- come on.
- Almost. Just logging off.

474
00:44:31,480 --> 00:44:34,517
- Stay on. Who cares? Leave it on.
- Got it!

475
00:44:34,600 --> 00:44:36,477
Good.

476
00:44:40,520 --> 00:44:42,397
All right.

477
00:44:43,360 --> 00:44:46,318
Thank you very much, Herr Shummaker!

478
00:44:58,240 --> 00:45:00,435
(Speaks German)

479
00:45:13,520 --> 00:45:15,670
- Go. Go!
- come on! come on!

480
00:45:24,280 --> 00:45:26,840
- You get it?
- Got it.

481
00:45:26,920 --> 00:45:29,229
- You all right?
- No, I'm not all right!

482
00:45:29,320 --> 00:45:33,711
- Brilliant idea, smash his face in.
- That's how things get done.

483
00:45:33,800 --> 00:45:36,314
A few bribes,
it never happened at all, right?

484
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:38,675
check the seats,
they go all the way back.

485
00:45:38,760 --> 00:45:40,637
- 0h, yeah.
- cool.

486
00:45:40,720 --> 00:45:43,951
- Embassy car.
- CD player, bullet-proof glass,

487
00:45:44,040 --> 00:45:45,189
everything.

488
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:46,269
0h, shit!

489
00:45:50,440 --> 00:45:52,317
We...may have a problem.

490
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:54,470
This will cost us. What do you have?

491
00:45:54,560 --> 00:45:57,313
- Eighty.
- That's enough. I'll be back.

492
00:45:59,240 --> 00:46:01,196
Hold this.

493
00:46:05,360 --> 00:46:08,477
- So you think he set us up?
- Who?

494
00:46:08,560 --> 00:46:11,996
- Your friend.
- No.

495
00:46:12,080 --> 00:46:16,358
- How can you be so sure?
- Because he's my friend.

496
00:46:19,880 --> 00:46:22,519
He needs more money. Give me...

497
00:46:26,680 --> 00:46:28,989
(kelly) 0h, my God!

498
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:34,234
Out!

499
00:47:04,600 --> 00:47:06,716
Get up front. Get up front!

500
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:08,756
Up front?

501
00:47:11,720 --> 00:47:14,518
- They're behind us.
- How many of them?

502
00:47:14,600 --> 00:47:16,158
Two...three.

503
00:47:16,240 --> 00:47:19,152
Reach into that briefcase.
Pull out an extra magazine.

504
00:47:25,240 --> 00:47:27,435
- Where is it?
- In the briefcase.

505
00:47:27,520 --> 00:47:29,158
Damn it!

506
00:48:02,080 --> 00:48:03,752
Seat belt.

507
00:48:17,840 --> 00:48:19,671
(kelly screams)

508
00:48:57,960 --> 00:49:01,839
come on, what's wrong with you?
What's wrong with you?!

509
00:49:04,640 --> 00:49:07,290
What are you doing?

510
00:49:07,120 --> 00:49:09,760
Shit!

511
00:49:58,360 --> 00:50:00,157
(Shouting in German)

512
00:50:02,760 --> 00:50:04,352
No! NO!

513
00:50:52,520 --> 00:50:54,556
- come on.
- The invoices.

514
00:50:54,640 --> 00:50:56,676
- come on!
- The invoices!

515
00:50:56,760 --> 00:50:58,830
- come on, God damn it!
- No!

516
00:50:59,960 --> 00:51:01,916
Go, go! GO!

517
00:52:09,520 --> 00:52:12,800
Dimitri has a...

518
00:52:12,160 --> 00:52:13,991
..a daughter, Tasha.

519
00:52:15,080 --> 00:52:17,514
Sixteen. She lives in Rybinsk.

520
00:52:21,200 --> 00:52:23,236
l remember when she was three.

521
00:52:27,480 --> 00:52:30,870
She's... She's beautiful.

522
00:52:41,480 --> 00:52:43,436
it doesn't make sense, you know?

523
00:52:44,720 --> 00:52:48,998
You don't...kill a Dimitri Vertikoff.

524
00:52:49,080 --> 00:52:53,631
There are certain rules.
killing him isn't useful.

525
00:52:54,760 --> 00:52:56,716
Is it ever?

526
00:53:18,280 --> 00:53:21,477
l never watched anybody die before.

527
00:53:34,160 --> 00:53:37,118
(computer)
'Welcome. You've got mail.'

528
00:53:39,400 --> 00:53:44,713
l e-mailed Shummaker's files to
my A0L account before l logged off.

529
00:53:47,640 --> 00:53:49,631
Did it work?

530
00:53:50,840 --> 00:53:53,798
Uh...yeah.

531
00:53:54,880 --> 00:53:58,919
We're looking for a vehicle hired
in the Urals on about June 29.

532
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:00,797
Right?

533
00:54:00,880 --> 00:54:04,316
- The truck's too small.
- Yes. St Petersburg, one direction.

534
00:54:04,440 --> 00:54:09,639
Point of origin, chelyabinsk.
Registration number, 7056BM.

535
00:54:09,720 --> 00:54:12,109
Destination, Imisli 44E.

536
00:54:12,200 --> 00:54:15,829
That's Azerbaijan.
it's just south of Russia.

537
00:54:16,200 --> 00:54:18,191
Five miles from fuckin' Iran!

538
00:54:18,280 --> 00:54:20,919
He crosses that border
and those nukes are gone!

539
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:22,877
We got a bank-routing code number.

540
00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:26,999
There's no client names. "44E",
does that mean anything to you?

541
00:54:27,080 --> 00:54:29,150
- What?
- Shummaker put a private memo

542
00:54:29,240 --> 00:54:31,276
on the invoice. it can't be copied.

543
00:54:31,360 --> 00:54:35,690
This is Devoe, we have a target
vehicle. it's a cargo truck.

544
00:54:35,160 --> 00:54:37,879
Registration 7056 Bravo Mike.

545
00:54:37,960 --> 00:54:41,589
it's travelling south from
chelyabinsk to Imisli in Azerbaijan.

546
00:54:41,680 --> 00:54:44,672
l am requesting
a high-priority tasker.

547
00:54:44,760 --> 00:54:48,116
Any birds...
Any birds find this truck.

548
00:54:48,200 --> 00:54:50,191
We've got nukes heading for Iran.

549
00:54:50,280 --> 00:54:53,330
What the hell is 44E?

550
00:55:14,520 --> 00:55:17,353
(Arguing in Serbian)

551
00:55:25,040 --> 00:55:27,600
(Serbian) Gentlemen, please.

552
00:55:28,760 --> 00:55:31,228
Zarko Preljevik has died.

553
00:55:32,400 --> 00:55:36,837
He never regained consciousness
after being shot outside his church.

554
00:55:37,240 --> 00:55:39,435
His death is a tragic loss

555
00:55:39,880 --> 00:55:43,509
to his family, to his country,
to our hopes of peace.

556
00:55:43,600 --> 00:55:45,556
(Murmuring)

557
00:55:46,560 --> 00:55:49,154
We know you've
avoided politics, Dusan,

558
00:55:49,560 --> 00:55:52,280
but you are the alternate.

559
00:55:52,960 --> 00:55:54,996
Your people need you.

560
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:18,231
l am a Serb. I'm a croat.

561
00:56:18,320 --> 00:56:20,276
I'm a Muslim.

562
00:56:21,720 --> 00:56:24,917
You will look at what
l have done and say,

563
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:29,278
"0f course. Why not?
They are all animals."

564
00:56:29,360 --> 00:56:32,557
They have slaughtered
each other for centuries.

565
00:56:32,640 --> 00:56:34,870
But the truth is,

566
00:56:34,960 --> 00:56:36,951
l am not a monster.

567
00:56:37,800 --> 00:56:39,756
I'm a human man.

568
00:56:39,840 --> 00:56:41,796
I'm just like you,

569
00:56:41,960 --> 00:56:44,315
whether you like it or not.

570
00:56:44,520 --> 00:56:46,476
(Soldiers chattering)

571
00:56:49,040 --> 00:56:50,917
(Man) Hey, Rich, how you doing?

572
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:54,117
We haven't seen you
since the great scud hunt!

573
00:56:54,200 --> 00:56:57,317
- captain Santiago, sir.
- Hello, captain.

574
00:56:57,400 --> 00:57:01,393
This is Lieutenant Beach. He'll
run the operation from the ground.

575
00:57:01,480 --> 00:57:04,233
- Gentlemen, have you found him?
- Damn close, sir.

576
00:57:04,320 --> 00:57:06,470
Giving them an
average speed of 65 clicks,

577
00:57:06,560 --> 00:57:10,300
if their destination is Imisli
and they take a direct route,

578
00:57:10,120 --> 00:57:11,997
we put them about here, in Dagestan.

579
00:57:12,080 --> 00:57:14,958
Still in Russia,
below Makhackala on the caspian Sea.

580
00:57:15,040 --> 00:57:18,476
We've looked at everything
within a 200-square-mile area.

581
00:57:18,560 --> 00:57:22,678
We haven't found the truck.
They're probably stuck here, in kuma.

582
00:57:22,760 --> 00:57:25,194
There's a hell
of a traffic jam down there.

583
00:57:25,280 --> 00:57:28,670
Trucks are too close together.
We can't get an angle on the plates.

584
00:57:28,760 --> 00:57:32,389
- What's going on down there?
- Armenia and Azerbaijan fighting.

585
00:57:32,480 --> 00:57:35,233
Roads are clogged
with refugees fleeing north.

586
00:57:35,320 --> 00:57:39,740
ken? Get me a copy of kodoroff's
intel phone records.

587
00:57:39,160 --> 00:57:42,311
- What are you thinking?
- l need an outside line.

588
00:57:42,400 --> 00:57:45,597
Somebody give me
an outside line, please?

589
00:58:00,560 --> 00:58:02,516
(Horn)

590
00:58:05,760 --> 00:58:07,716
Filthy fucking refugees.

591
00:58:07,800 --> 00:58:11,310
Azerbaijani, Georgian, kazhakstani.

592
00:58:12,160 --> 00:58:14,628
Don't curse them.

593
00:58:14,720 --> 00:58:18,793
l don't care what bitch gave
birth to them, Muslim, Serb.

594
00:58:19,880 --> 00:58:22,519
l don't hate them for who they are.

595
00:58:22,600 --> 00:58:24,795
l hate them because they are poor.

596
00:58:24,880 --> 00:58:26,836
(Phone rings)

597
00:58:27,400 --> 00:58:29,356
(Speaks Russian)

598
00:58:32,920 --> 00:58:35,718
- 'Alek, how's the ride down there?'
- Who is this?

599
00:58:35,800 --> 00:58:38,109
Doesn't traffic drive you nuts?

600
00:58:38,200 --> 00:58:41,556
- Who the fuck is this?
- 'it's Tom Devoe. How you been?'

601
00:58:41,640 --> 00:58:45,553
You still humpin' that
Finnish stewardess with the bad skin?

602
00:58:45,640 --> 00:58:50,395
Tom. Are you still trading
stolen cars on the black market?

603
00:58:52,360 --> 00:58:56,592
Hey, Alek, you watched CNN
during Desert Storm.

604
00:58:56,680 --> 00:59:00,150
Remember those shots from
the nose of the missiles

605
00:59:00,240 --> 00:59:02,151
slammin' into those trucks?

606
00:59:03,360 --> 00:59:05,316
'Remember that picture?

607
00:59:05,400 --> 00:59:08,676
'How it kept gettin' closer
and bigger on the screen?'

608
00:59:08,760 --> 00:59:12,469
You could just about see the faces
of those drivers, and then...

609
00:59:12,560 --> 00:59:17,310
Zap, the picture went dead.
We didn't see what happened next.

610
00:59:17,120 --> 00:59:19,760
Well, guess what, Alek?

611
00:59:20,840 --> 00:59:23,798
You will, you son of a bitch.

612
00:59:24,240 --> 00:59:26,800
Shit. Get out of the way!

613
00:59:34,200 --> 00:59:36,839
- l guess that upset him.
- can you get an angle?

614
00:59:36,920 --> 00:59:39,593
He rear-ends some guy,
can it detonate that nuke?

615
00:59:39,680 --> 00:59:42,690
As long as no one opens the primary,
it's 0k.

616
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:50,116
come on, sweetie. come on.

617
00:59:51,400 --> 00:59:53,356
It's coming.

618
00:59:55,880 --> 00:59:57,757
70-56 Bravo Mike. That's it.

619
00:59:57,840 --> 01:00:00,308
How long until
the satellite's out of range?

620
01:00:00,400 --> 01:00:03,153
- 0ne hour, 46 minutes.
- contact Russian command.

621
01:00:03,240 --> 01:00:05,196
Give them the location of the truck.

622
01:00:05,280 --> 01:00:06,838
Boom!

623
01:00:58,080 --> 01:01:01,390
(kelly) We only have them under
surveillance for another hour.

624
01:01:01,480 --> 01:01:04,870
(Devoe) it doesn't matter what
the State Department says.

625
01:01:04,960 --> 01:01:07,679
(kelly) No, l understand, sir.

626
01:01:07,760 --> 01:01:09,990
(Both) Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.

627
01:01:11,200 --> 01:01:13,316
- Ok, go. You go.
- No, you go first.

628
01:01:13,400 --> 01:01:15,994
l talked to the chairman
of the Joint chiefs.

629
01:01:16,080 --> 01:01:19,755
- Department's draggin' their feet.
- l was talking to the President.

630
01:01:19,840 --> 01:01:22,700
He says the Russians
have to manage it.

631
01:01:22,160 --> 01:01:23,957
No, we have the advantage!

632
01:01:24,040 --> 01:01:26,508
The Russians say
they are handling this.

633
01:01:26,600 --> 01:01:30,149
The Russians couldn't find snow
in the middle of fuckin' winter.

634
01:01:30,240 --> 01:01:33,391
When that satellite is out of range,
those nukes are gone.

635
01:01:37,360 --> 01:01:40,113
it's only jet fuel.

636
01:01:41,800 --> 01:01:44,633
- Get up into NAT0.
- Good for you. Let's go. Rich?

637
01:01:44,720 --> 01:01:46,995
No, wait. Wait, colonel.

638
01:01:47,080 --> 01:01:51,232
With Russia determined to handle this
take no action without authorisation.

639
01:01:51,320 --> 01:01:53,880
Do you think I'm some
stupid son of a bitch?

640
01:01:53,960 --> 01:01:55,837
No, l don't think you're stupid.

641
01:01:55,920 --> 01:01:58,514
You're a talented soldier
with bad impulse control.

642
01:01:58,600 --> 01:02:00,591
l don't want
an international incident

643
01:02:00,680 --> 01:02:04,798
- because of a personal agenda.
- My personal agenda is my business.

644
01:02:04,880 --> 01:02:06,871
Now you are not in Washington.

645
01:02:06,960 --> 01:02:08,916
You are in the real world,

646
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:11,309
and there are nuclear arms
heading for Iran.

647
01:02:11,400 --> 01:02:16,300
So whether you agree with me
or not, get me authorised!

648
01:02:49,840 --> 01:02:51,796
(Serbian) We must go, Dusan.

649
01:03:16,200 --> 01:03:18,714
cobra Three, this is Tango Six.
What have we got?

650
01:03:18,800 --> 01:03:22,429
(kelly) 'Russian command has been
notified of target's location.

651
01:03:22,520 --> 01:03:24,670
'Proceed and await instructions.'

652
01:03:24,760 --> 01:03:28,150
- Does NR0 have anything for us?
- They got us on standby.

653
01:03:28,240 --> 01:03:30,196
How much time are we looking at?

654
01:03:30,280 --> 01:03:32,111
We can track'em for 45 minutes.

655
01:03:32,200 --> 01:03:36,790
We'll alert lF0R at Bazta checkpoint.
They have to pass through there.

656
01:03:50,760 --> 01:03:52,716
Put that away.

657
01:04:07,760 --> 01:04:10,479
(Russian) Step out
of the truck, please.

658
01:04:21,400 --> 01:04:23,356
I'm sorry, General.

659
01:04:23,440 --> 01:04:25,635
We've been ordered
to check all vehicles.

660
01:04:25,720 --> 01:04:28,678
We're just carrying medical supplies.
Let us through.

661
01:04:28,760 --> 01:04:31,149
I'm sorry sir, but l have orders.

662
01:04:31,240 --> 01:04:33,470
Look at your code book, Sergeant.

663
01:04:35,160 --> 01:04:38,630
Today's authorisation code
is... X16...7kTR...B

664
01:04:40,240 --> 01:04:42,959
Yes, but l still have
to search the truck.

665
01:04:43,040 --> 01:04:44,598
What is your name and unit?

666
01:04:44,680 --> 01:04:46,750
Name and unit, you hear me?

667
01:04:53,320 --> 01:04:57,279
- I'm sorry, General. Go ahead.
- Thank you, Sergeant.

668
01:05:05,760 --> 01:05:07,671
Stop.

669
01:05:09,400 --> 01:05:12,995
I'm sorry, sir, you'll have
to get out of the truck.

670
01:05:13,080 --> 01:05:15,514
Get out of the truck immediately!

671
01:05:16,640 --> 01:05:18,471

- Will it work?
- it can be activated by one man.

of two kilotons.

01:17:15,800 --> 01:17:17,870
Six, what happened?

789
01:17:17,960 --> 01:17:21,475
0ne assault aircraft is gone.
Nine men are dead.

790
01:17:21,600 --> 01:17:24,797
kodoroff is dead,
and we have recovered

791
01:17:24,880 --> 01:17:26,791
eight nuclear warheads

792
01:17:26,880 --> 01:17:29,348
- in their containers.
- That's not enough.

793
01:17:29,440 --> 01:17:32,910
- What?
- 'That's not enough damn warheads.'

794
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:36,470
- For once, say something nice.
- it was an SS18, ten warheads.

795
01:17:36,560 --> 01:17:39,791
0ne detonated, eight there.
That leaves one unaccounted for.

796
01:17:39,880 --> 01:17:43,310
colonel Devoe,
there's somebody alive down here!

797
01:17:43,120 --> 01:17:46,669
Hold on a minute. Take this.
Motherfuck!

798
01:17:46,760 --> 01:17:48,716
God damn it!

799
01:17:50,600 --> 01:17:52,556
We got a live one, colonel.

800
01:17:55,720 --> 01:18:00,191
- Do you speak English?
- Yes, l went to Harvard.

801
01:18:00,280 --> 01:18:03,511
Go, crimson!
Help me up, please.

802
01:18:03,600 --> 01:18:05,830
- Where's the other warhead?
- Bring me up.

803
01:18:05,920 --> 01:18:07,558
Listen.

804
01:18:07,640 --> 01:18:10,916
You are gonna die unless you tell
me where the other warhead is.

805
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:13,798
- l don't know. He took it.
- Who?

806
01:18:13,880 --> 01:18:17,236
l don't know his name.
He's with the ones who arranged this.

807
01:18:17,320 --> 01:18:20,232
- kodoroff?
- No, he just handled the money.

808
01:18:20,320 --> 01:18:22,231
it was the other one!

809
01:18:22,320 --> 01:18:26,199
He made me dismantle the primary,
make it mobile.

810
01:18:26,280 --> 01:18:29,192
- How?
- it's in his backpack.

811
01:18:29,280 --> 01:18:31,236
Help me up, please?

812
01:18:44,720 --> 01:18:47,473
(Soldier) Just hang on.
We'll bring you up.

813
01:18:53,120 --> 01:18:56,715
kelly? A guy got away with a bomb.

814
01:18:56,800 --> 01:19:00,110
'copy, Devoe.
All right, come on back.'

815
01:19:05,640 --> 01:19:08,438
Got it. The bank account
on the kordech invoice.

816
01:19:08,520 --> 01:19:12,115
Registered to an address in Grbavica,
a Serbian suburb of Sarajevo.

817
01:19:12,200 --> 01:19:16,830
Good. Get this information to IF0R.
Tell them to proceed with caution.

818
01:19:29,080 --> 01:19:31,710
Where are you going?

819
01:20:24,400 --> 01:20:26,356
(Serbian) You made it.

820
01:20:26,440 --> 01:20:28,396
l told you l would.

821
01:20:28,920 --> 01:20:30,876
Is it heavy?

822
01:20:32,320 --> 01:20:34,276
We must go.

823
01:21:26,320 --> 01:21:29,596
- Are you all right?
- I've been better. How about you?

824
01:21:29,680 --> 01:21:34,470
I've been better. We traced the money
to a man named Vlado Mirich.

825
01:21:34,560 --> 01:21:37,996
lF0R found a tape in his apartment.
They're sending it to us now.

826
01:21:38,080 --> 01:21:40,469
They say it has
a terrorist message on it.

827
01:21:40,560 --> 01:21:42,994
colonel, the guy you caught
is Dr Amir Taraki.

828
01:21:43,080 --> 01:21:47,390
Pakistani. PhD in astrophysics.
Educated at Harvard.

829
01:21:47,120 --> 01:21:50,112
That's right. We educated
half the world's terrorists.

830
01:21:50,200 --> 01:21:52,770
Tell me exactly what he said.

831
01:21:52,160 --> 01:21:55,357
He took the primary from the warhead
and put it in a backpack.

832
01:21:55,440 --> 01:21:57,670
The primary is full of plutonium.

833
01:21:57,760 --> 01:21:59,990
it could take out ten city blocks

834
01:22:00,080 --> 01:22:04,676
and kill 100,000 people in a densely
populated area like Sarajevo.

835
01:22:04,800 --> 01:22:08,395
(Mirich) 'You will look at
what l have done and say,

They are all animals.

837

lF0R can shut down Bosnia.
He'll never get into Sarajevo.

865
01:23:42,960 --> 01:23:45,315
Wait, he's not going there.

866
01:23:45,400 --> 01:23:48,836
We weren't meant to find this until
after he'd detonated the bomb.

867
01:23:48,920 --> 01:23:51,559
"Pain the peacemakers
must be made to feel."

868
01:23:51,640 --> 01:23:55,474
The peacemakers aren't in Bosnia.
They're in Europe and the US.

869
01:23:55,560 --> 01:23:59,109
- They're signing a treaty this week.
- Tomorrow at the UN.

870
01:23:59,200 --> 01:24:01,794
- What's the address?
- By the river, east side.

871
01:24:01,880 --> 01:24:04,997
Forty-fourth Street, 44E.

872
01:24:07,880 --> 01:24:10,750
He's goin' to New York.

873
01:24:29,960 --> 01:24:31,916
What've you got?

874
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:36,730
We can only close the airport with
a Nuclear Emergency Response Plan.

875
01:24:36,160 --> 01:24:39,152
- it has to come from her.
- I'll give it to her.

876
01:25:01,520 --> 01:25:03,476
l wanted to know

877
01:25:04,400 --> 01:25:06,356
who they were.

878
01:25:47,920 --> 01:25:50,195
Secure line to NMcc.

879
01:25:51,760 --> 01:25:53,716
This is Dr Julia kelly.

880
01:25:53,800 --> 01:25:58,112
l am issuing a presidential directive
for a Federal Nuclear Emergency Plan.

881
01:25:58,200 --> 01:26:00,873
We have a possible weapon
of mass destruction

882
01:26:00,960 --> 01:26:04,919
coming into the United States by
unknown terrorist or terrorists.

883
01:26:24,560 --> 01:26:26,915
- check in the rear.
- Yes, sir.

884
01:26:27,000 --> 01:26:29,798
commencing diplomatic evacuation.

885
01:26:33,000 --> 01:26:35,958
Ladies and gentlemen,
your attention please.

886
01:26:36,040 --> 01:26:39,555
I'm with the UN. We've been informed
of a threat to the treaty signing.

887
01:26:39,640 --> 01:26:42,632
We must get you off this plane
to ensure your safety.

888
01:26:42,720 --> 01:26:45,290
lf you would all please stand up.

889
01:26:45,120 --> 01:26:46,473
Thank you.

890
01:26:46,560 --> 01:26:49,313
Move to the exits
at the rear and front of the aircraft

891
01:26:49,400 --> 01:26:51,197
in orderly fashion.

892
01:27:16,640 --> 01:27:19,290
- Glad you made it. coffee?
- No, thank you.

893
01:27:19,120 --> 01:27:21,714
- l took a few Stay-Awakes earlier.
- Dr kelly?

894
01:27:21,800 --> 01:27:23,836
- I'm fine.
- How many did she take?

895
01:27:23,920 --> 01:27:26,115
This is Mark carey, Energy.

896
01:27:26,200 --> 01:27:29,715
Here, Special Agent in charge,
David Branigan, FBI.

897
01:27:29,800 --> 01:27:32,712
We're running NYPD and Agency
response from here

898
01:27:32,800 --> 01:27:34,597
in co-ordination with D0E.

899
01:27:34,680 --> 01:27:36,875
- Evacuation plans?
- National Guard.

900
01:27:36,960 --> 01:27:39,872
- What about NEST?
- Energy has containment teams

901
01:27:39,960 --> 01:27:41,678
on alert in Battery Park.

902
01:27:41,760 --> 01:27:43,591
We're running casualty scenarios.

903
01:27:43,680 --> 01:27:46,956
initial blast would throw 60 rads
of radiation out 3 miles.

904
01:27:47,040 --> 01:27:49,429
That's most of lower Manhattan
and Queens.

905
01:27:49,520 --> 01:27:51,909
2.5 to 3 million people,
50% survival rate.

906
01:27:52,000 --> 01:27:56,516
Monitor wind patterns, and we need
radiation detectors, ground and air.

907
01:27:56,600 --> 01:28:00,700
- lntel report from lF0R.
- Let me see that.

908
01:28:00,160 --> 01:28:02,276
Vlado Mirich, Bosnian-Serb, radical.

909
01:28:02,360 --> 01:28:05,477
Been missing for about a week.
Father fought with Tito.

910
01:28:05,560 --> 01:28:09,109
Has a half-brother who was
a pianist in Sarajevo.

911
01:28:09,200 --> 01:28:12,988
He's been arrested 3 times
for smuggling and black-marketeering.

912
01:28:13,080 --> 01:28:15,719
- it's gotta be him.
- No, something's wrong.

913
01:28:15,800 --> 01:28:20,157
The man in the tape. He's no black
marketeer and he's not a nationalist.

914
01:28:20,240 --> 01:28:23,730
He said, "l am a Serb,
a croat and a Muslim".

915
01:28:23,160 --> 01:28:28,109
He's holding everybody responsible.
The background doesn't fit.

916
01:28:28,200 --> 01:28:31,954
I've got a V Mirich on SwissAir
Flight 1204 from Zurich to kennedy.

917
01:28:32,040 --> 01:28:34,110
- Arriving when?
- 7 minutes ago.

918
01:28:34,200 --> 01:28:36,555
call JFK. Send 'em a picture.

919
01:28:38,240 --> 01:28:40,117
Excuse me!

920
01:28:42,280 --> 01:28:44,953
cover all the exits.
Nobody gets out. Nobody!

921
01:28:46,320 --> 01:28:50,552
- SwissAir, 1204, non-residents.
- Station 20.

922
01:28:53,560 --> 01:28:55,312
(kelly) He's not here.

923
01:28:55,760 --> 01:28:59,116
- He's not here!
- We got a possible lD at desk 7.

924
01:28:59,200 --> 01:29:01,156
it's the far corner.

925
01:29:04,040 --> 01:29:05,871
Excuse me.

926
01:29:09,960 --> 01:29:11,757
Vlado Mirich?

927
01:29:17,440 --> 01:29:18,953
Yes?

928
01:29:23,080 --> 01:29:25,360
Who the hell is this?

929
01:29:39,640 --> 01:29:41,392
All right.

930
01:29:41,480 --> 01:29:44,233
Passport's fake.
Said he bought it in Sarajevo.

931
01:29:44,320 --> 01:29:46,470
We've been able to detain eight men

932
01:29:46,560 --> 01:29:49,916
with passports issued by countries
of the former Yugoslavia.

933
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:52,833
- None matches your description.
- Where the hell is he?

934
01:29:52,920 --> 01:29:55,673
- Eight?
- Not including the delegations.

935
01:29:55,760 --> 01:29:58,115
- What?
- They don't go through customs.

936
01:29:58,200 --> 01:30:00,191
in all, must be a couple of hundred.

937
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:41,595
No, ma'am. We are talking
about a terrorist situation.

938
01:30:41,680 --> 01:30:43,955
We need to detain
the entire delegation.

939
01:30:44,040 --> 01:30:47,396
These are diplomats, guests of
the US. l can't order them around.

940
01:30:47,480 --> 01:30:51,598
- Then l need names and room numbers.
- We're looking for Vlado Mirich.

941
01:30:51,680 --> 01:30:54,114
This man isn't named Vlado Mirich.

942
01:30:54,200 --> 01:30:57,510
This is Dusan Gavrich. He's with
the Bosnian-Serb delegation.

943
01:30:57,600 --> 01:31:01,957
Their minister was assassinated
last week. He took his place.

944
01:31:02,040 --> 01:31:03,837
The brother.

945
01:31:19,040 --> 01:31:20,837
(Beeping)

946
01:32:08,800 --> 01:32:10,631
Go!

947
01:32:19,560 --> 01:32:23,712
0h, shit. Diplomatic papers.
They never even searched it.

948
01:32:25,440 --> 01:32:27,396
Still warm.

949
01:32:40,480 --> 01:32:42,232
Move.

950
01:33:29,000 --> 01:33:30,956
(Gunshots and screaming)

951
01:33:37,680 --> 01:33:39,238
Nina!

952
01:33:44,520 --> 01:33:46,192
Nina!

953
01:34:15,280 --> 01:34:17,157
Help me!

954
01:34:17,240 --> 01:34:21,740
Help me! Help my child!

955
01:34:21,360 --> 01:34:23,316
Please help me!

956
01:34:27,240 --> 01:34:30,152
(Speaks Serbian)

957
01:34:59,360 --> 01:35:01,316
East 44th Street.

958
01:35:03,040 --> 01:35:06,770
- D0E, got anything yet?
- choppers are up.

959
01:35:09,240 --> 01:35:11,708
The backpack will be
leaking radiation

960
01:35:11,800 --> 01:35:14,314
so we can locate him
within a 3 to 4 block area.

961
01:35:14,400 --> 01:35:16,834
Set up roadblocks here.
We'll close off 2nd.

962
01:35:16,920 --> 01:35:20,370
Funnel him down 43rd.
Deploy snipers between 1st and 2nd.

963
01:35:20,120 --> 01:35:21,951
command centre.

964
01:35:22,040 --> 01:35:25,271
General, we have to close down
the east side of Second Avenue

965
01:35:25,360 --> 01:35:29,592
from 55th to 42nd and the north side
of 42nd from Sixth to the river.

966
01:35:29,680 --> 01:35:32,399
(Devoe) 'We're gonna be
in position at the UN.

967
01:35:32,480 --> 01:35:35,199
'instruct all field agents,
all snipers,

968
01:35:35,280 --> 01:35:37,475
'subject cannot be aware
of the hunt.'

969
01:35:55,560 --> 01:35:58,996
Something big at UN today.
Traffic bad all morning.

970
01:36:05,960 --> 01:36:08,554
- (kelly) 'chopper 0ne, anything?'
- Negative.

971
01:36:08,640 --> 01:36:13,475
'HQ, kelly. We're gonna work
our way south into the funnel.'

972
01:36:13,560 --> 01:36:16,393
Suggest stopping anyone
with a backpack north of 55th.

973
01:36:16,480 --> 01:36:18,994
Roger. How soon will
you get to the UN?

974
01:36:19,080 --> 01:36:20,991
This is a national emergency.

975
01:36:25,920 --> 01:36:30,380
- Get over here and spread 'em.
- Put your hands on your head!

976
01:36:34,600 --> 01:36:37,114
Who are the fascists now, huh?

977
01:36:40,720 --> 01:36:42,676
come on!

978
01:37:00,600 --> 01:37:02,556
0k, guys, let's move it out.

979
01:37:04,120 --> 01:37:06,760
come on. Let's move it.

980
01:37:25,920 --> 01:37:29,710
- What the hell is this?
- We have instructions to...

981
01:37:29,160 --> 01:37:33,517
it looks like Desert Storm!
Get these men outta here now!

982
01:37:34,520 --> 01:37:36,397
- colonel.
- Yeah.

983
01:37:36,480 --> 01:37:38,152
Where's the containment trucks?

984
01:37:38,240 --> 01:37:40,117
- it's grid locked.
- Where are they?

985
01:37:40,200 --> 01:37:44,591
There's a radiation source between
Third and Second, 54th and 46th.

986
01:37:44,680 --> 01:37:48,832
- can you be more precise, D0E?
- 'Not at this altitude.'

987
01:37:48,920 --> 01:37:52,913
keep an open channel. When we locate
him, go with the NEST team.

988
01:38:16,760 --> 01:38:19,911
HRT command, put me direct
with your closest shooter.

989
01:38:20,000 --> 01:38:22,195
- 'Hunter One, copy.'
- This is 0ne.

990
01:38:22,280 --> 01:38:24,874
(Devoe)
'Expect he's comin' your way, 0ne.'

991
01:38:24,960 --> 01:38:28,919
- (0ne) 'Do we have a green light?'
- (Devoe) 'Affirmative.'

992
01:38:41,720 --> 01:38:44,234
(0fficer)
Get outside the barriers, folks.

993
01:38:54,440 --> 01:38:58,672
l think he's between First
and Second, probably below 46th.

994
01:38:58,760 --> 01:39:00,716
All positions, do you see target?

995
01:39:01,440 --> 01:39:03,431
No, sir. Not me.

996
01:39:04,600 --> 01:39:08,700
come on. come to Papa.

997
01:39:15,120 --> 01:39:18,874
This is Four. Target acquired.
Three hundred metres.

998
01:39:18,960 --> 01:39:20,916
Not clean. Too many friendlies.

999
01:39:21,160 --> 01:39:24,835
- This is Leader. Take the shot.
- There's a child, a family.

1000
01:39:24,920 --> 01:39:27,480
Acknowledged. Take the shot.

1001
01:39:30,040 --> 01:39:32,395
Shoot him. come on.

1002
01:39:33,520 --> 01:39:36,239
Four, this is Leader.
l repeat, take the shot.

1003
01:39:37,560 --> 01:39:39,551
Take the shot!

1004
01:39:39,640 --> 01:39:41,995
Shoot him! Take the shot!

1005
01:39:44,120 --> 01:39:45,633
0h, God.

1006
01:39:45,720 --> 01:39:48,473
God damn it! Somebody shoot him!

1007
01:39:51,520 --> 01:39:55,354
This is 0ne. l have target acquired.
Four hundred yards, inbound.

1008
01:39:55,440 --> 01:39:57,590
No shot. Should open at 43rd.

1009
01:40:02,800 --> 01:40:04,199
FBI!

1010
01:40:10,400 --> 01:40:13,437
Take it easy, all right?
Just get outta here.

1011
01:40:15,480 --> 01:40:17,436
Dispatch, this is 1501.

1012
01:40:17,520 --> 01:40:20,830
l need backup on 43rd Street
as soon as you can get it for me.

1013
01:40:20,920 --> 01:40:24,310
Leader, this is 0ne.
Waiting for target to clear.

1014
01:40:25,680 --> 01:40:28,558
You with the backpack,
get your hands up.

1015
01:40:28,640 --> 01:40:30,995
Get your hands up!

1016
01:40:31,600 --> 01:40:34,353
I'm a diplomat
with the United Nations.

1017
01:40:36,400 --> 01:40:38,356
l must be allowed to pass.

1018
01:40:39,680 --> 01:40:41,716
Leader, I've lost him. He stopped.

1019
01:40:41,800 --> 01:40:44,758
- What?
- He went behind some trees.

1020
01:40:44,840 --> 01:40:47,991
He's gotta be there.
Reacquire. Move if you have to.

1021
01:40:48,080 --> 01:40:52,390
- What's in the backpack? cuffs.
- You got it.

1022
01:40:55,080 --> 01:40:57,913

corner of 43rd and Second.

1024
01:41:00,960 --> 01:41:02,279
Is he down?

1025
01:41:05,760 --> 01:41:07,796
Is he down?

1026
01:41:07,880 --> 01:41:11,555
(0ne) 'Negative.
They're southbound, toward 42nd.'

1027
01:41:11,640 --> 01:41:14,740
Stay in contact with
the containment trucks

1028
01:41:14,160 --> 01:41:16,469
and have them ready
to move on my command.

1029
01:41:16,560 --> 01:41:19,740
- Where are you from?

1030
01:41:19,160 --> 01:41:21,116
Give me the keys.

1031
01:41:33,720 --> 01:41:35,711
0ut of the way! D0E, you have him?

1032
01:41:35,800 --> 01:41:38,519
He's eastbound on 42nd.

1033
01:41:40,840 --> 01:41:42,432
Get out of the way!

1034
01:41:50,680 --> 01:41:52,330
Go!

1035
01:42:48,760 --> 01:42:52,389
- East of Second, off 41st.
- He went down there!

1036
01:42:52,480 --> 01:42:54,436
Stay behind me!

1037
01:43:06,920 --> 01:43:09,718
Drop your weapon,
and show me your fuckin' hands.

1038
01:43:09,800 --> 01:43:11,870
We got him. Alley off 41st.

1039
01:43:16,960 --> 01:43:18,916
(Yells)

1040
01:43:27,960 --> 01:43:30,918
- You all right?
- Yeah.

1041
01:43:55,160 --> 01:43:58,755
(Radio) 'The signal just quit.
He's gotta be indoors.'

1042
01:43:58,840 --> 01:44:00,796
0h, Vlado.

1043
01:44:07,160 --> 01:44:10,197
(Speaking Serbian)

1044
01:44:13,880 --> 01:44:16,713
(Door opens and bell rings)

1045
01:44:17,320 --> 01:44:18,673
Move!

1046
01:44:18,760 --> 01:44:20,751
- (Screaming)
- Move! Move!

1047
01:44:22,520 --> 01:44:24,192
Move!

1048
01:44:29,080 --> 01:44:32,550
- Anybody have him?
- (Radio) 'Negative. Nothing.'

1049
01:44:32,640 --> 01:44:35,916
- D0E, what have you got?
- 'Still picking up an energy source

1050
01:44:36,000 --> 01:44:39,515
'somewhere in the area.
We're circling back now.'

1051
01:44:42,160 --> 01:44:44,116
He'll never make it to the UN.

1052
01:44:44,200 --> 01:44:46,270
No need to.
He's got a nuclear weapon.

1053
01:44:46,360 --> 01:44:50,353
He just sits down behind a dumpster
and destroys half of Manhattan.

1054
01:44:50,440 --> 01:44:53,340
He doesn't wanna die
behind a dumpster.

1055
01:44:53,120 --> 01:44:55,190
He wants his death to mean something.

1056
01:44:55,280 --> 01:44:59,340
Fan out. We've got a new perimeter.
He's gotta be within 200 yards.

1057
01:44:59,120 --> 01:45:01,680
- Look for blood.
- There's no sign, colonel,

1058
01:45:01,760 --> 01:45:03,990
he probably ducked into a building.

1059
01:45:04,080 --> 01:45:07,436
- keep looking.
- 'We'll circle a six-block area.'

1060
01:45:07,520 --> 01:45:09,636
(choir singing)

1061
01:45:12,280 --> 01:45:13,633
Devoe!

1062
01:45:14,600 --> 01:45:16,352
Listen.

1063
01:45:44,160 --> 01:45:45,912
(Speaks Serbian)

1064
01:45:47,800 --> 01:45:49,677
(Shouts)

1065
01:45:51,040 --> 01:45:52,553
Go! Go!

1066
01:45:54,400 --> 01:45:56,356
(children screaming)

1067
01:45:57,960 --> 01:46:00,520
Father, take these children. Move it!

1068
01:46:00,600 --> 01:46:02,989
(Priest) come on, quickly, girls.

1069
01:46:14,600 --> 01:46:17,239
come on. Give me your hand.
Give me your hand.

1070
01:46:17,320 --> 01:46:18,992
Let's go.

1071
01:46:20,000 --> 01:46:21,831
Go, go, go, go.

1072
01:46:36,000 --> 01:46:38,116
You cannot stop this.

1073
01:46:38,200 --> 01:46:40,156
Never!

1074
01:46:41,520 --> 01:46:43,317
Ok.

1075
01:46:44,600 --> 01:46:47,558
0k, just...just stay still.

1076
01:46:47,640 --> 01:46:49,915
Stay there.

1077
01:46:50,040 --> 01:46:51,996
Stay still.

1078
01:46:52,080 --> 01:46:53,911
it's Ok.

1079
01:46:58,600 --> 01:47:00,591
You don't wanna die like this.

1080
01:47:02,320 --> 01:47:06,836
Tell me about the bomb.
Is it on the trigger?

1081
01:47:08,080 --> 01:47:10,833
Is it on a timer? Is it activated?

1082
01:47:10,920 --> 01:47:12,956
come on, talk to me.

1083
01:47:13,040 --> 01:47:15,310
We can decide on a way out of this.

1084
01:47:15,720 --> 01:47:17,472
No!

1085
01:47:19,760 --> 01:47:22,638
Who decided for my wife?

1086
01:47:23,760 --> 01:47:26,228
My child, murdered. Huh?

1087
01:47:27,640 --> 01:47:29,596
For what?

1088
01:47:30,560 --> 01:47:32,516
For what?

1089
01:47:35,600 --> 01:47:37,556
For breathing?

1090
01:47:38,120 --> 01:47:39,951
For smiling?

1091
01:47:41,360 --> 01:47:43,510
And now, l am left.

1092
01:47:50,440 --> 01:47:53,340
Who decides for me?

1093
01:47:53,120 --> 01:47:55,873
Mr Gavrich, what is it you want?

1094
01:47:59,080 --> 01:48:02,516
(Speaks Serbian)

1095
01:48:02,640 --> 01:48:04,915
l want it to be...

1096
01:48:06,080 --> 01:48:08,360
..like it was.

1097
01:48:11,120 --> 01:48:13,111
Sir, it's not our war.

1098
01:48:18,200 --> 01:48:20,270
- lt is now.
- No!

1099
01:48:23,800 --> 01:48:25,552
Son of a bitch.

1100
01:48:25,640 --> 01:48:27,551
Where the hell is NEST?

1101
01:48:29,920 --> 01:48:33,390
- it's on a timer.
- Listen, the bomb's on a timer.

1102
01:48:34,560 --> 01:48:36,437
ken, where the hell are they?

1103
01:48:36,520 --> 01:48:38,750
- l don't know.
- ken, tell me NEST is here.

1104
01:48:38,840 --> 01:48:42,196
'Affirmative.
They'll be there in four minutes.'

1105
01:48:44,840 --> 01:48:47,673
They're not gonna make it.
They're not gonna make it.

1106
01:48:47,760 --> 01:48:50,957
0k, you're gonna have to do this.

1107
01:48:51,040 --> 01:48:53,349
Understand?
Look at this, what do you see?

1108
01:48:53,440 --> 01:48:56,671
Take a look at this
and tell me what you see!

1109
01:48:57,760 --> 01:49:01,992
An SS18 primary with a plutonium
core. A bomb inside a bomb.

1110
01:49:02,080 --> 01:49:05,755
it has a capacitor-relay detonator,
double pull, double throw.

1111
01:49:05,840 --> 01:49:08,434
The only way of knowing
is to open it up.

1112
01:49:08,560 --> 01:49:10,730
What?

1113
01:49:12,840 --> 01:49:16,116
Let's move it into the chapel.
Get it off him. Get it off!

1114
01:49:16,200 --> 01:49:19,590
Hang on. We got a trip wire.
We'll move the man and the bomb.

1115
01:49:19,680 --> 01:49:21,716
All at once. Here we go. Ready? Go.

1116
01:49:21,800 --> 01:49:23,756
Let's go! careful!

1117
01:49:25,680 --> 01:49:27,830
Get the gate!

1118
01:49:27,920 --> 01:49:31,469
- Why in here?
- it'll help contain the radiation.

1119
01:49:31,560 --> 01:49:35,917
Get out of the church and evacuate
as many people as you can.

1120
01:49:38,480 --> 01:49:40,710
- l need something for the screws.
- Here.

1121
01:49:40,800 --> 01:49:42,950
- Anything. Quick!
- Go, go.

1122
01:49:52,520 --> 01:49:54,556
Devoe, get out of here.

1123
01:49:54,640 --> 01:49:57,996
0k, I'll be in the truck!

1124
01:50:19,440 --> 01:50:23,228
The plutonium core
is surrounded by explosive panels.

1125
01:50:23,320 --> 01:50:25,880
Uh, give me the knife.
l need the knife back.

1126
01:50:26,880 --> 01:50:28,916
lf we can separate one of the panels,

1127
01:50:29,000 --> 01:50:33,676
we may be able to blow up
the outer bomb without...

1128
01:50:33,760 --> 01:50:36,752
the core going to nuclear yield.

1129
01:50:36,840 --> 01:50:40,355
You're gonna blow this up.
You're gonna blow up the bomb?

1130
01:50:40,440 --> 01:50:43,989
You know what you're doin', right?
You've done this before?

1131
01:50:44,080 --> 01:50:47,629
Defused stolen nuclear primaries
jerry-rigged by Pakistanis?

1132
01:50:47,720 --> 01:50:48,709
No.

1133
01:51:02,560 --> 01:51:04,312
Ah, damn!

1134
01:51:07,960 --> 01:51:10,997
l need your gun.
Give me the gun, l need the gun.

1135
01:51:11,080 --> 01:51:12,798
Go.

1136
01:51:15,360 --> 01:51:17,635
Easy, easy, easy, easy!
it's all right.

1137
01:51:19,440 --> 01:51:21,908
(Devoe) 14...13...12... Let's go!

1138
01:51:22,000 --> 01:51:23,752
it won't move!

1139
01:51:23,840 --> 01:51:26,195
10...9...8...

1140
01:51:26,280 --> 01:51:28,840
come on! 7...6...5.

1141
01:51:28,920 --> 01:51:30,876
Go, go, go, go!

1142
01:51:33,840 --> 01:51:35,796
(Rapid beeping)

1143
01:51:42,880 --> 01:51:45,917
come here. Are you 0k?

1144
01:51:46,000 --> 01:51:48,468
Hey, are you Ok?

1145
01:51:48,560 --> 01:51:50,551
come here. come here.

1146
01:51:51,600 --> 01:51:53,352
come here, hey.

1147
01:51:53,640 --> 01:51:56,632
- You Ok?
- l think so.

1148
01:52:12,760 --> 01:52:14,512
Hey, listen, you're 0k.

1149
01:52:14,600 --> 01:52:16,556
All right?

1150
01:52:16,640 --> 01:52:18,790
Sir, we need you
to go with these medics.

1151
01:52:18,880 --> 01:52:20,677
Yeah, go. Go.

1152
01:52:24,280 --> 01:52:26,953
Julia, Julia!

1153
01:52:27,120 --> 01:52:29,760
Julia!

1154
01:52:30,840 --> 01:52:32,796
Julia!

1155
01:53:24,760 --> 01:53:28,116
- So, they give you any new medals?
- Yes, they did.

1156
01:53:28,200 --> 01:53:31,158
- Well, you worked hard for them.
- Thank you.

1157
01:53:35,040 --> 01:53:38,919
We've got kind of a tradition
over at military ops.

1158
01:53:39,000 --> 01:53:42,993
Whenever combatants come back
from the field in one piece,

1159
01:53:43,080 --> 01:53:45,435
we buy each other a beer.

1160
01:53:46,840 --> 01:53:49,752
- You made that up.
- Yes, l did.

1161
01:53:56,120 --> 01:53:58,998
Well, um... l got ten more to go.

1162
01:54:03,320 --> 01:54:05,276
I'll wait.
